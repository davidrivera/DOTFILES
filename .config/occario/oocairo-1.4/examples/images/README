The image "pattern.png" is a 15 seconds gimp job, so it's probably not even
covered by copyright. Still, I'm going to license this under the WTFPL 1.0 or
later ("Do What The Fuck You Want To Public License").

The other images in this directory a photographs taken by Geoff Richards,
and are hereby made public domain.  Do what you want with them.
